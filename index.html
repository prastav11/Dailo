        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Prastav Koirala. I'm deeply inspired by minds like Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Richard Feynman, and the courageous Stephen Hawking. I love thinking about the universe, time, and the mysteries of life.</p>
        <p>One day, a teacher asked me, “Why would you like to be like Kalpana Chawla?” That one question changed my whole perspective. I answered, “So that someday, a teacher like you will ask, why would you like to be like Prastav Koirala?”</p>
        <p>And I'm working every day, waiting for that day to come.</p>
        <p>I believe that being born human gives us the gift of thought and curiosity. We're not just here to survive—we're here to explore, to learn, and to leave something meaningful behind. As Stephen Hawking said, “It surprises me how disinterested we are today about things like physics, space, the universe and philosophy of our existence, our purpose, our final destination. It’s a crazy world out there. Be curious.”</p>
